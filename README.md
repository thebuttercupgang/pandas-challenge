Analysis
The following is a summary of school data pulled from 15 schools comprising 39,170 students total.
	In general, students tend to test better in reading than they do in math by a margin of 11%
	Grade level does not correlate with an increase in test scores. Mean test score remains relatively stable as grade level increases
	Schools with a lower per capita budget tend to have higher test scores. There is a large decrease in percent of students passing math as per student budget increases.
	Smaller schools tend to have higher test scores. This is seen most dramatically when looking at percent passing test scores. Schools with under 1000 students have an 89.9% pass rate whereas schools with 2000-5000 students have a 58.3% pass rate.
	Charter schools tend to have higher test scores and passing rates. The top 5 schools with highest percentage passing overall were all charter schools while the bottom 5 schools were all district schools.

Potential Conclusions
	Test scores will not increase with an increase in school budget
	Schools with smaller student bodies have better test scores
	Charter schools produce higher test grades
